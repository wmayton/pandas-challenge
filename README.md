This repository contains work providing analysis of the Heroes of Pymoli data set. In the 'Heroes of Pymoli' folder, you will find a .csv-file of the data itself, a link to a Jupyter notebook containing my code, as well as a short .txt document describing three observable trends that emerged from the data.
