Given our results, there are a few observable trends within the data. 

One, purchase frequency is highly correlated with age. The 18-22 demographic accounts for over twice 
as many purchases as any other cohort. It is possible that this demographic plays Heroes of Pymoli more frequently 
then other age cohorts. Secondly, it is clear that maleâ€™s play Heroes of Pymoli much more frequently than women and 
other/non-disclosed people, who together account for only 16.4% of players. Third, the five most profitable items only accounted 
for 8.8% of total revenue, and the five most popular items only accounted for 8.1% of total revenue. This means that 
total revenue is not highly dependent on only the most popular or profitable items, but rather the sale of a wide range of items.
